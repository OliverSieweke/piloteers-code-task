# Piloteers Code Task

This is a coding task done for Piloteers aiming at providing an external endpoint for users to upload json files with
 location descriptions as well as an internal API to retrieve information about the uploaded locations.

## Getting Started 

## Documentation

You can find the project's documentation [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/OliverSieweke/piloteers-code-task/blob/master/docs/index.html). (Depending on your browser configurations, you may encounter issues viewing the 
documentation properly through the github html preview - in that case you may prefer to directly open the `/docs/index` file on your local machine)

The project's documentation uses [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html) syntax and is generated with [documentation.js](https://documentation.js.org/).
You can use the following commands in the project:

- Tho rebuild the documentation (then available in the `/docs` directory):
```bash
$ npm run docs:build
```

- To serve the documentation locally on port 4001:
```bash
$ npm run docs:serve
```

- To check the documentation syntax:
```bash
$ npm run docs:lint
```
